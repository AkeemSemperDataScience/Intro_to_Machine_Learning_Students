    "N-grams are a way to capture the relationship between words. For example, the phrase \"downhill skiing\" is a 2-gram, those two words together are a specific \"thing\", different from the words \"downhill\" and \"skiing\" by themselves. The N in n-grams is the number of words in the phrase that are stored as one token. Allowing n-grams that are longer than one word cam be extremely helpful in allowing our feature set to better capture the meaning of our text, it is common to have multi-word terms-of-art, product names, descriptions (e.g. \"dirty blonde\"), and so on. On the (potential) downside, it can increase the number of features dramatically, and can make the feature set more sparse. When allowing larger n-grams, particularly, it is common to limit the number of features up front and/or use some techniques later on to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set. A feature set that is 20 times wider than it is tall is probably not going to be ideal. \n",

    "We can allow longer n-grams with a hyperparameter, for this example I allowed things up to 3, we can see that the number of features will explode in size as now any up to n-word long sequence can be a feature in our feature set. "

    "## More Elaborate Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above we've done a \"base\" level of modelling - we transform the free text into something that we can process (the bag of words), and we can make predictions from it much like we would with any other one-hot encoded data. This process works fine, and it does deliver some pretty accurate results on our test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create NLP models that are more functional we can add some layers to our processing of the text to improve our understanding of the nuances of our text. Some things we can do are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> <b>Remove Stop Words</b> - common words like \"it\", \"a\", \"the\" are normally not all that useful in predicting the meaning, we can filter these out. \n",
    "<li> <b>Stemming</b> - coverting words down to their \"stem\". E.g. \"reasoning\" to \"reason\"\n",
    "<li> <b>Lemmatization</b> - similar to stemming, but tries to identify the correct stem contextually. E.g. \"Operating systems\" probably shouldn't become \"operate\" and \"system\"\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, stemming increases recall while harming precision. Lemmatization has similar impacts, but tends to be less aggressive, so the effects are smaller. The specific results are highly variable depending on the exact text that is used. Something that uses specific variations of words to mean specific things (e.g. science) is more likely to get no benefit or be negatively impacted - e.g. \"conditonally\" used in the context of a \"conditionally approved loan\" is probably not well represented by changing it to \"condition\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### NLTK Library\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is a library that provides a bunch of language processing stuff that we can use such as stop words and tokenizers. We'll leverage it here to make custom tokenizers to incorporate some of those features above. The things we are downloading here are pre-made sets of data, like stop words, and pretrained lists of \"root words\" that we can use to break words down into their root format. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> the \"for package\" part there downloads the wordsets to your computer. NLTK has these prebuilt libraries of data that allow for the functions to do the stop words, stemming, and lemmatization. It might take a minute the first time you run it."

    "The vecorization libraries in sklearn allow you do specify the function to use to do tokenization. We can use this to include other processing that we'd like as part of the process, such as removing stop words or stemming. The tokenizer functions below can, potentially, contain anything you'd like. As long as the call function returns a list of tokens, it should work. \n",

    "<b>Note:</b> if you look up examples, these functions will often be written into one lines, I broke them out so they're hopefully easier to read. They would also likely be much faster if we were to vectorize the code instead of using loops, but again, this is easy to read. \n",

The stemming techniques here aren't explicit comparisons of those similarity types, but they follow the same concepts.
