We'll first need to clean up our data a bit before we can assemble it for modelling. The initial cleaning bits are just like what we used in NLP, we just need to get rid of all the junk. \n",

    "We can use pretty much anything that you can imagine as source, and assuming we can gather enough data and train our model, the generated speech will be styled after the source. I liken it to going on vacation in Indonesia and talking to Indonesians who spoke English like Australian surfer bros - their training data was a little weird, so the output was a little weird too. If you're looking to build your best ChatGPT competitor you will want a lot of data, specifically a lot of data that is representative of the full gamut of how you want your model to write. If you want slang in the new text, you can't really train on Shakespeare and Wikipedia."

    "We are going to be a little slack in the construction of the datasets for training because we are limited in the amount of resources we can handle. All of the datasets that are fed to the model need to be the same length, so we'll set a cap and trucate it here for resource concerns. Our dataset will be constructed as:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> A sequence of (up to) 24 words as the X data. \n",
    "<li> The next word as the Y data.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "So each sequence is effectively one set of features, and its target is the next word. If we were doing this in reality, we'd want to prep more records from our sample:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Suppose a sample sentence is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\". Our ideal data would have something like:\n",
    "    <ul> \n",

    "This is superior both because we are generating much more data to train the model and because we are training the model to predict words in all different positions in the sentence. We'd be predicting almost every word in the training dataset. The words that frequently end a sentence are not necessarily the same as the words that start a sentence or sit in the middle, so making predictions up and down the text will likely lead to a more useful model.\n",

    "### Generate Some Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate text once the model is trained. We'll start with a seed sentence, and then we'll use the model to predict the next word. We'll then append that word to the sentence and use the model to predict the next word, and so on. There is a little helper function to do this for us with limited repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another new thing is that we create an inverse dictionary to map the encoded words back to the original words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "One weirdly named factor that is important in text generation is the temperature. The temperature is a factor that we can use to control the randomness of the output. To generate text, we are essentially using a probability distribution to determine what the next word should be - the softmax output of the model will tell us the most likely next word. The issue is that certain words are way more likely than others - \"the\", \"it\", \"a\", \"and\", etc. are all very common words so we can expect the model to predict them as \"most likely\" a lot, probably too often. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Temperature](images/temperature.gif \"Temperature\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct way to combat this is to add some degree of randomness to which word we select - we'll still pick the most likely word more often than any other, but we'll also pick other words that have some degree of likelihood at random. The higher the temperature the more randomness is introduced. A correct value requires tuning with human feedback, and it'll vary depending on the base quality of the model - large models that are trained on huge volumes of text and are deep enough to pick up on the \"what type of word should be here\" patterns will be able to generate better text with lower temperatures. Our model here is small and kind of sucks, so the temperature needs to be higher to get anything remotely usable. The implementation here is stolen shamelessly from the internet, the details don't really matter all that much, we just need to vary our predictions away from always simply picking the most likely word."
